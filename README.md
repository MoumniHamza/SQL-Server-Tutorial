This SQL Server tutorial is for anyone who wishes to learn how to use SQL Server. It assumes a basic understanding of databases 
and how they work.

This tutorial covers the 2014 edition of SQL Server (SQL Server 2014). Specifically, it uses (the free) SQL Server 2014 Express 
with Tools.

If you don't currently have an understanding of how databases work, start with the basic database tutorial first(http://www.quackit.com/database/tutorial/). 
That tutorial covers the basic concepts of databases, so the examples in this tutorial will make more sense once you return here.


To get the most out of this tutorial, you should have a copy of SQL Server installed on your computer, so that you can go through
the examples yourself. If you don't have a copy, that's OK â€” you should still be able to gain an understanding of what SQL Server
is and what's involved in using it.
